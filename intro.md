## UNIGIS - Big Data in Sustainability Science

Data is everywhere around us. But how can we make use of all this data to answer questions in sustainability sciences? How can twitter data help us to understand where and how severe people are affected by floods? Or how can we use earth observation data to classify land use? 

In the course *Big Data in Sustainability Science*, you will learn the tools and knowledge to work with large datasets that are widely used within sustainability sciences. This ranges from classifying land cover through machine learning approaches and earth observation data, to using OpenStreetMap to perform a detailed natural hazard risk assessment using public data.
