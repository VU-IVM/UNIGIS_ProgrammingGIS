    "# Lecture: Loading API geodata and clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will focus on how we can use Flickr and loading web-hosted geodata from API services to map the spatial patterns of images. We will also learn how to perform data aggregation and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{admonition} Learning objectives\n",
    ":class: important\n",
    "- Become familiar with the Flickr API and how its data is structured\n",
    "- Gain some familiarity with querying and collecting web data\n",
    "- Learn more techniques on how to filter, clean, aggregate, and plot open geodata in Python\n",
    "- Learn to aggregate data on a grid in Python\n",
    "- Learn how to prepare data for clustering methods\n",
    "- Learn the basics of K-Means clustering to understand data beyond spatial patterns\n",
    "`````\n",

    "## Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming web data standards\n",
    "We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the standards for geospatial data processing - specifically:\n",
    "- [OGC standards, for understanding the standardization of geospatial ](https://opengeospatial.github.io/e-learning/ogc-standards/text/services-ogc.html)\n",
    "- [WFS, for accessing vector features](http://opengeospatial.github.io/e-learning/wfs/text/basic-main.html)\n",
    "- [WMTS, for loading (web map) tiles](https://opengeospatial.github.io/e-learning/wmts/text/operations.html)\n",
    "- [WCS, for spatio-temporal access to raster datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Service)\n",
    "And for those that want to go a little deeper, we recommend studying how [RESTful data](https://restfulapi.net/) is structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "For clustering, we will once again have a look at the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/rabbee/s154/ISLR_First_Printing.pdf) by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. This time, we take a look at unsupervised learning, specifically `K-Means` clustering. Specifically, read sections 10.1, 10.3.1, and 10.3.3 of the book. Section 10.3.2 is useful for those wanting to know more about clustering methods which don't need a pre-specified number of K, but it is not necessary to read it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those wanting to read a little bit more about the purpose of clustering, here are some suggestions for further reading and for inspiration on how clustering can further prove useful:\n",
    "- [Thunderstorm Environments in Europe](https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2023/egusphere-2022-1453/egusphere-2022-1453-manuscript-version2.pdf) - the authors use clustering to study thunderstorm variables\n",
    "- [Analysis of urban heat island effect using k-means clustering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5691908) - The authors study the urban heat island effect in a similar fashion to the first paper\n",
    "- [Traffic Accidents Analytics in UK Urban Areas using k-means Clustering for Geospatial Mapping](https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/125145/CameraReady_PID237.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) - Applications on traffic accident data"
