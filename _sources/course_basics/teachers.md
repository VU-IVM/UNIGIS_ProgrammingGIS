|<img src="../_static/images/levering-profile.jpg"  class="bg-primary" width="150px">|Alex Levering is an Assistant Professor at the department of Environmental Geography and the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His background is in remote sensing and geo-information sciences, with a specialisation in computer vision methods. His research focuses on studying the semantics of landscapes from image materials in both natural and urban environments. He has studied how well landscape quality preferences can be predicted using computer vision methods. He has also studied the interpretability of models, the combination of visual and non-visual information for predictive models, and approaches for modelling with small datasets. |

She holds a PhD in Civil Engineering and Environmental Science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, where her research was primarily focused on developing data reduction methodologies for stochastic seismic risk assessment of infrastructures. She develops solutions that not only advance academic understanding but also benefit communities facing the challenges of climate change and natural hazards.|
