|<img src="../_static/images/levering-profile.jpg"  class="bg-primary" width="150px">|Alex Levering is an Assistant Professor at the department of Environmental Geography and the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His background is in remote sensing and geo-information sciences, with a specialisation in computer vision methods. His research focuses on studying the semantics of landscapes from image materials in both natural and urban environments. He has studied how well landscape quality preferences can be predicted using computer vision methods. He has also studied the interpretability of models, the combination of visual and non-visual information for predictive models, and approaches for modelling with small datasets. |

|<img src="../_static/images/shirazian-profile.jpg" class="bg-primary" width="150px">|Shadi Shirazian is a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Water and Climate Risk of the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). She holds a PhD in Civil Engineering and Environmental Science from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany, where her research was primarily focused on developing data reduction methodologies for stochastic seismic risk assessment of infrastructures. She develops solutions that not only advance academic understanding but also benefit communities facing the challenges of climate change and natural hazards.|

|Sadhana Nirandjan, MSc||
|:-:|:--|
|<img src="../_static/images/nirandjan-profile.jpg" class="bg-primary" width="150px">|Sadhana Nirandjan is a PhD researcher within the department of Water and Climate Risk (WCR) at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. In her current research, she aims to increase our understanding of the multi-hazard risk to critical infrastructure at the global scale. She developed the Critical Infrastructure Spatial Index (CISI) to identify the geospatial location of critical infrastructure and its density for each part of the world. Other aspects that are covered by her research are, under which, the vulnerability of assets, and the quantification of risks on our critical infrastructure due to natural hazards.

|<img src="../_static/images/raj-profile.jpg" class="bg-primary" width="150px">|Surender Raj is a Ph.D. candidate in the Water and Climate Risk (WCR) department at the Institute for Environmental Studies (IVM) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. His research interests include infrastructure resilience, vulnerability modeling, and the economic impacts of natural hazards. His current research focusses on quantifying the macro economic impacts of infrastructure failures due to natural hazards. |
